## Project Description

Your task is to create a presentation of the data within the JSON files. The first page that the user should see should be a login screen and then it should be a view or several views to show case the customers information/customer current insurances and the available insurances.
Customers can have different memberships even without insurances.
The customer can have old contracts for insurances above their membership level due to that the insurances doesnâ€™t get cancelled when a customer downgrades its membership.
Higher level memberships has access to the lower levels insurances.
